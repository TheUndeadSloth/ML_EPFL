# ML_EPFL P1

Project 1 in Machine learning course at EPFL

## Handling data

We unpacked the test.csv and train.csv to the Data-folder, but the files are too big to share so we have .gitignored them and loaded them individually.

## Files

We have implementations.py with the 6 mandatory functions: least_squares + GD, SGD, ridge_regression, logistic_regression + penalized

And we have the main file run.py with the code to generate our predition

We have helpers.py with helper functions that will be called either by run.py or the functions in implementations.py

we have Aditional functions that just includes the crossvalidation used in our project

The folder pictures contains the graphs mentioned in the report that did not fit
